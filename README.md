## MCMAS in a Container

MCMAS is a model-checker for multi-agent systems that supports temporal epistemic logic.  MAS descriptions are given by means of programs written in the ISPL language.  ISPL is an agent-based, modular language inspired by interpreted systems, a popular semantics.  It describes things like: agents, groups, environments, states, evolutions, protocols, and fairness.  Temporal logic operators include AG/EF/AX. Epistemic logic supports K/GK/GCK/DK.

For MCMAS source/manual, see the [official page at SAIL](https://sail.doc.ic.ac.uk/software/mcmas/) or this [unofficial mirror](https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/mcmas).
